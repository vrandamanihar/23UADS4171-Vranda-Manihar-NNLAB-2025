Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to develop a deep learning model using transfer learning to classify medical images into different categories. Specifically, the task is to classify images from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset into multiple categories, including normal, melanoma, benign, and suspicious. The model is trained using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which is fine-tuned for our dataset. We will also evaluate the model using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curve.

Description of the Model:
The model uses MobileNetV2 as the base model for transfer learning. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for mobile and edge devices. The model is pre-trained on ImageNet and is used to extract features from images.

The architecture of the model is as follows:

Base Model (MobileNetV2): The convolutional layers are pre-trained on ImageNet and are used as feature extractors.

Global Average Pooling: A pooling layer to reduce the dimensionality and convert the feature maps to a single vector.

Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer): A dense layer with 4 units, one for each class (normal, melanoma, benign, suspicious), with softmax activation to handle multi-class classification.

The model is compiled with:

Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy, which is suitable for multi-class classification.

Optimizer: adam, a popular optimizer for training deep learning models.

Evaluation Metric: Accuracy, which measures the proportion of correct predictions.

Description of the Code:
Data Preprocessing:

The code unzips the dataset and organizes images into subdirectories corresponding to their labels (normal, melanoma, benign, suspicious).

Data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, shifts, etc.) are applied to improve model generalization.

Model Architecture:

MobileNetV2 is used as a feature extractor with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.

The model is fine-tuned by adding a Global Average Pooling layer followed by a Dense layer with 4 units (for 4 classes).

Softmax activation is used for multi-class classification.

Training:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

The model is trained for 10 epochs using the augmented training data.

Evaluation:

The training loss and accuracy are plotted.

The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.

The trained model is saved to disk for future use.

Performance Evaluation:
Accuracy:

The modelâ€™s accuracy is plotted during training and evaluated on the test data.

The final test accuracy is printed after the evaluation step.

Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the true vs predicted classifications, which is a good way to assess misclassifications.

Loss Curve:

The training loss curve is plotted to show how the loss decreases as the model learns.

My Comments:
Limitations:

Limited Dataset: If the dataset is small, the model may overfit. More data would improve the generalization ability of the model.

Overfitting: MobileNetV2 has many parameters, and training on a small dataset could lead to overfitting. More techniques like dropout or fine-tuning could be considered.
